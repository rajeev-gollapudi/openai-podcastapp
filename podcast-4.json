We are live with an event on the SAP community and looking to get some live audience interaction on this topic if you aren't too shy. Today's topic is a good one. In the spirit of SAP Learning's Digital Skills Initiative, to get more people considered to be underrepresented into the tech industry, I wanted to talk about strategies and tactics for people who find themselves in a disadvantaged or underprivileged position in life. What can they do to climb the socioeconomic ladder, at least specific to North America? So we're going to talk about some other similar topics for other countries, but starting in North America. And today with us to help us understand this topic a bit more is Margo Goodson, Head of Diversity and Inclusion for North America. Margo, welcome to the podcast. Hi there David, thanks for having me. Glad to have you on board. And with the start of every single one of these podcasts, we always want to get the hero's origin story. Where you're from, how'd you find yourself as the professional you are today? Oh wow, that's a big question. Where I'm from, originally North Philadelphia and born and raised part of my life and then Willingborough, New Jersey and then went to an HBCU. And so I've had quite the journey and it's been ups and downs, good things and bad things of course, as all of us probably have experienced. And how I found myself here is a lot of hard work, goodwill and people in my corner throughout my life. Being raised by a single mother after my father passed, she really did provide for us. I feel like we didn't really know we wanted and needed what we did. But then that gave me a lot of an opportunity for education, formal education as well as informal education and certifications. And that brought me through my collegiate career and all that kind of stuff. And I'm sure you've got questions specific to it. But going to Hampton University, which I consider the best HBCU around, availed me so much. And I had great work experiences. Technology always seemed to touch everything even back when it wasn't as prominent as it is today. And learning and growing through those various methodologies enabled me to have a fresh start way back in 1990 with Coopers and Librarian as it were. And then from there, many, many different work experiences that led me to tech, using tech in the ways that we have in each company. And then specifically getting at SAP, now 16 years, five roles, three different board areas and enjoying my passion as my profession as North America head of diversity and inclusion. Very cool. Was there a specific spark or inspiration that you had in your childhood that led you down the academic path? So like when you were leaving high school, did you have an idea what you wanted to do? I thought I did. So I was in Girl Scouts coming up and Girl Scouts availed you so much, different experiences and such. And so I was taking this tech class back then it was like Cobalt and Fortran, Mr. Mugglesworth. Now I'm like, oh, I'm going into IT. But then I took an accounting class where we were kind of the owners of this cycle center project. And it did leverage a little bit of technology and it leveraged a lot of business acumen. And so I actually set out to be an accounting major when I came to the university. I'm like, oh, I'm going to be a CPA. I'm going to have my own firm. And that's the route I'm going. I'm going to integrate my technology information and knowledge along with what I was learning from the business side and the law side. A lot of business law classes that I really, really enjoyed. And so that's what I set out to be. And I did. I got my CPA license. I worked in public accounting the required two years. I went that path through banking and health care and those sorts of things. So I came out of school believing that I knew what I wanted to do for a lifetime because numbers were my passion, but people were also always my passion. So that was what started me on the road to technology from high school looking onward to what I wanted to do in college and beyond. Okay, very cool. Yeah. Oftentimes I hear people, which is normal, like changing the course over the course of life, just having different interests and stuff like that. But I personally, I'm over the opinion that it's always, it's very important at a minimum to complete the current course of study, get your certification, get your diploma, get whatever is you're initially pursuing before changing course, just so you have that nice extra thing to show for yourself on the CV. So really cool that you follow through with the CPA part. You got your foot into the door there. You start your career, you got some professional experience, and then when you decide to pivot and move towards something else, you already have some good experience under your belt certifications as well. Even to the extent of being self-employed, I got my Six Sigma Green Belt along with my CPA license and decided that I wanted to be self-employed for a little while. I took a career break as many do to raise family and such and decided when I came back one of my own hours, so I consulted for four years. And that's where also having my undergraduate degree, Bachelor of Science, plus having the certification as a CPA, and then now the Six Sigma Green Belt certification that enabled me to do even more in the consulting line of work and being self-employed. It's funny that sometimes people feel like it's a pivot, but as long as it's aligned with your career journey, it can help make you more marketable as you embark on those different ambitions and learning operations that are available. Outstanding. So in the spirit of the goal of the podcast, would you say that you found yourself at a significant disadvantage growing up or did you consider that you've moved up through the socioeconomic over the course of your life? I would definitely say I moved up. I would say I did start out feeling a significant disadvantage. The surroundings that I was in in North Philadelphia, that it didn't feel like there was a lot of opportunity when I looked around at some of the circumstances. However, I did see a lot of hardworking people and I understood very early that if you had talent and abilities and you worked hard, it could potentially lead you along the way. And based on my grades and academic success, I was placed in an academically talented program, which gave us different access to different workshops and leaders that helped us to understand how to grow within our network of peers, as well as mentors and sponsors, even at an early age. So I feel like I did have some disadvantage in the beginning, but then my mother moved us to a new neighborhood in New Jersey, in Willowboro, New Jersey, and I was exposed to different programs. I was a part of this club called Design Two Women, which was a business club. And I started to see how just finally academics could make a difference in what you were able to do. I was able to get a job. I was working at McDonald's in high school. And then that taught me about others who had internships at the collegiate level. So that really helped me too. So climbing up the socioeconomic ladder came from, you know, working and going to school simultaneously, having internships at orthopharmaceutical and being the first in my class to get an offer for after college at Coopers and Librarian. I was able to secure that. And every job I had, I made sure I did two things outside of my core role. They gave me exposure to the people in the company, which then also impacted my compensation, right? When you're doing more and you're involved and you're visible, you get lateral moves, you get upward moves, and that impacts your compensation, your bonus structure, and things of that nature that do allow you to climb up the socioeconomic ladder. And I will say, I never thought I'd send all three of my kids to private high school and already put two through college with one in 11th grade about to go soon. It has definitely benefited me, you know, and it enables me to give back, give back very heavily financially and of my time and my church and community. So certainly while I may have started out in somewhat of a disadvantage, I wouldn't say extremely significant, but somewhat of a disadvantage, I'm grateful and blessed by all the things that I've been able to do over the years. As I climbed that through the corporate ladder, sometimes upward, sometimes lateral, we have to be open for that. But then also just some ancillary investments and things that I was able to do that you learn from the different exposures along the years. Okay. Yeah. So really important to look outside of what's familiar maybe and draw inspiration from what other people are doing and maybe putting together your own map from different places of the world that you've experienced and seen. And when somebody is approaching academia, so going back to like the transition jumping from high school to university, me personally, myself, I was amongst the first to actually achieve a college education in my family. I joined the US Army, they paid for it. And I found myself at a private university in Germany surrounded by a lot of very wealthy students who what I felt like were sort of groomed from very early childhood to be in this university environment and sort of felt like a fish out of water, so to speak. And this is a really intimidating experience for me at the time. And I think it'll vary a lot according to one's circumstances. Would you be able to share any tips for people facing this process for the first time like jumping into this alien world of tweed sweaters and tweed jackets and well to do students here to your left and your right? Well, it can be quite daunting and scary to start a new chapter of life in any way. I won't say that I had the same experience as did you with, you know, buttoned up folks as you describe them. But I do know that it was like a fish out of water for me that my mother and father didn't go to college. And, you know, this was new territory for me, my uncle on my aunt's married side of the family had to help me to navigate even getting into college. And I can certainly say that I was at Hampton University and there were a lot of students who looked like me but had different experiences. And they did come from families who had already been through college and such. So I think just being courageous about your efforts, being persistent to not give up, know that learning comes in different shapes, right? And so you want to get that degree, you want to get extra learning on the side, some tutoring, things like that. You want to leverage your peer network and your teachers and professors. You want to lean on mentors, coaches, sponsors as much as possible, even at the collegiate level. You know, it's something to be said for following through with your dreams and not giving up, right? You want to make sure you're taking classes that are offered by university, but looking for those outside certifications. I mean, let's face it, college isn't for everyone. So sometimes you can get that academic learning and be in a continuous learning mode in other ways, in certifications like we have here, and certifications like community organizations operate with. We used to do a volunteer tax service as part of our accounting rotation in the community and that helped us learn how to do the taxes even better because we were learning it in class and applying it out in the community. So look for those various ways of achieving that academic rigor and excellence and to be visible because that's going to help you with your journey as well. Work-study is another way to help when you're in that collegiate world, making that transition. Not every school offers that, but in North America, a lot of the colleges and universities do. So you can also leverage that as a way of getting more familiar in your settings and offering something to the community and then even getting paid for that if or applied to your college tuition. So those are all different ways of learning and navigating the space while you're in college and it actually looks good and setting you up for what you'll do outside of college. Just like when you're in high school, you're trying to bolster up all the activities you're a part of and learnings that you have and credentials that you're gaining to get you into that college of choice. Likewise, in college, you want to do the same thing and bolster up your resume for when you're looking for that first job. All right. Yeah. So instead of maybe being intimidated by these folks that you maybe not have so much in common by, use them as a source of inspiration. You can learn from them. Again, as you said it before, look outward for inspiration. Don't necessarily compare yourself. Don't try to be like other people, but take what you like from what they're doing, piece it together and make your own path. You have to have your own motivators, right? We're all driven by different things. You hear people say your network is your network and you want to deposit into it, make contributions and withdraw from it. But your path is your own path and no one can tell you that's right or wrong. I've had to take some steps backwards and sideways to get where I am today, but I was never afraid to do that, right? Fear can be immobilizing. And so to not let that happen, and it's easier said than done, but to be inspired, motivated and educated and know that you can do perhaps that too in a different version makes a huge difference. All right. And another challenge that maybe folks from different parts of the socioeconomic spectrum don't necessarily have to deal with is financial management, dealing with money. People have a wide range of experiences of what they're taught about money as little kids. I was not raised in a wealthy family by any measure, but one thing I was taught was the quite simple principle of never spending more than you make. And that alone was already a huge help for me to make myself independent in the world fairly early. I didn't get that memo so early. All right. So I'm probably asking the right person then. Do you have any tips out there for people who are coming from a place without money and maybe they do everything that you described and land their first job and this is the first time they have a real decent income. This is the first time they're not necessarily just worrying about making the rent and getting groceries that they maybe have a little bit extra coming in. Do you have any tips or insider thoughts that you could share with people who are experiencing a surplus income for the first time in their lives and their career on what they should and should not do maybe? I will say should or should not because that's obligatory. However, I will say it could benefit you if, right? If you didn't get into credit card debt too quickly, if you pay off your student loans as quickly as possible, if you have any, if you put aside that percentage of savings up front and you don't even see it and then and give out as to whom much is given, much is required. So really trying to make donations and things like that, but saving, investing and putting aside your living money and being very strategic about it. To your point, try not to outspend your earnings. It looks like a lot on the paycheck until they take out all your taxes and benefits and things like that and you start and you start paying your normal bills. So you want to make sure that you're being a little bit savvy about it. If your companies offer 401k at a minimum, get into that. If they offer additional financial advisory services, Vanguard or Fidelity or whomever, do that as well, right? Not advertising anybody. But I just remember back when I was in Coopers and Librarian, we worked a ton and we had a whole bunch of extra hours and compensation and things like that. And it was new to us and we were excited about that money. And so you want to make sure that you are leveraging it for your ability to succeed in life, but not being frivolous with it because anything can happen to that source of income at any given time, as we see in the economy and things like that. So you want to make sure that you are being strategic. So savings, investing and then your living money, you're setting that aside in your 10, 10, 80, whatever percentage that you feel best. But for sure, pay down that credit card debt if you have it as soon as possible. Pay down in student loans if you have it as soon as possible and plan. Plan for your future. Plan for your future. Don't miss out on matches that companies may give, whether that's in the 401k match or donation matches that you may give out. And don't try to save everybody around you because that unfortunately comes in too. If you come from a background where maybe everybody didn't have a lot, you may find yourself trying to take care of everyone around you. And for sure you want to help is again, to whom much is given, much is required. Yet you don't want to overextend and put yourself at a detriment. If you can't help yourself, then it makes it harder for you to help others. So I know those are the things that come to mind when I think about it from a financial aspect. Outstanding advice. Yeah. And I hope those folks who listen there can follow that because it's critical to not saddle yourself with so much debt, no matter how much you're making. If you're under the yoke of massive student debt or other sort of debt, I guess a house debt is probably acceptable. House mortgage is probably one of the few things you should be paying off as a credit. But no matter how much you're making, if you're saddled with a massive amount of debt, that's it's just overwhelming. You still have not achieved financial freedom, regardless of what your paycheck says. And even with houses, use them for investment purposes if you can, right? I mean, people make a lot of money off of real estate investment when it comes to houses. Indeed, spend money to make money in that respect. All right. The next one I wanted to touch on, and this one is wide ranging and everybody's experience has been radically different. That's the one, that's the topic of bias. So all it takes is like your name, appearance, or other characteristics to be judged negatively. That can lead to unfair treatment in the schoolhouse. It could lead to unfair treatment at job interviews, at work. It's often, it could be difficult to detect. And maybe I was wondering, how can you figure out if your negative experience was just a matter of your personality is not clicking or maybe your skill set's not matching or what if you are actually being discriminated against? What should somebody do if they're not sure? How does one know? You know, bias doesn't make us wrong, it makes us human, right? So we could be on the receiving end of it or we could unconsciously be one doing it to someone else, right? You can have bias towards someone in a very favorable way, but then you can have negative bias against people. And of course, I've lived all of those positively and negatively. What do you do? You know, you walk in your truth, right? So if someone has a negative bias against you, you want to show them the opposite of what they think. So if someone thinks less of you, you want to show your excellence. If you're not sure if they're saying it, question them. If you think what someone said to you is a bias, call them on the carpet. I'll never forget when I was working at Cooper's and my brand and I was handling my clients very well. My managing partner said to me as I wore my hair very nicely and done well all the time by the hairdresser, but it was an asymmetrical haircut at the time. He said, grow out one side or cut the other, you're not going to start clients like that. That was a bias statement. I was in the buttoned up three piece blue, black, brown suit, gray every week that they wanted. But my hair was an issue for them. And today there's Crown Act and things like that around hair. Like it doesn't determine the person's ability to do their job, but that's something that is usually a little bit more detectable. Sometimes there are biases around your zip code, what school you went to. I did that a lot of that, you know, around, I went to an HBCU. When everybody tries to get into our HBCUs, even if they're not historically black themselves, right? And that's historically black college, university, they see that education is just as good, just doesn't cost as much. So there have been some people who, oh, I'd rather Ivy League, I'd rather this school or that school. And there's nothing wrong with people having preferences, but it is if you're using it to disadvantage someone's experiences and opportunities for the workplace because of where they went to school. If they've secured that degree, they're, you know, proven that they're teachable and such. So when you ask the question of, you know, how to navigate through them, I say kill them with kindness, you know, be courteous and courageous in the, in the walks, but then also be strategic. If it's happening in a professional setting, you know, there is growth that comes with getting comfortable, being uncomfortable. And so sometimes you have to get uncomfortable to let individuals understand if they've offended you yet you want to be professional about it. So I would say that you're going to experience it, whether it is based on age, whether it's based on gender, sexual orientation, religion, ethnicity, you're going to face it and you may lodge it against others. So awareness, learning as much as you can, you know, using some of our own digital cheetah learnings and things like that, digital platform and such, we have inclusive mindset challenges, for example, that we leverage here at SAP. Now, when you go through the learnings and programs that you even teach from digital skills initiative perspective, you start to see that, yeah, everybody can learn these skills, right? And it doesn't matter your socioeconomic status, your gender, your ethnicity, your undergraduate school, if you've gone to a university, but it matters the education that you're experiencing and learning inside and outside of the workplace or academia, and that those things can help conquer bias. Okay, for those folks, so you use the term killing people with kindness and sort of moving on with your best foot forward. For folks who maybe have a negative enough experience where they're having trouble actually letting something go and maybe are letting their temper or a negative emotion getting the best of them when they feel they've been unjustly treated. Do you have any words of advice for people who maybe need to de-escalate their potential unprofessional or negative reaction to an experience such as being discriminated against? I can tell you what I do to de-escalate. I take a deep breath, say a little prayer, may have to go on a walk. I've been on calls where something happens and I immediately turn off the camera and put the mute on to deal with it within myself. Again, we're human, so sometimes things do hurt and you do get angry and upset. It's okay to excuse yourself from that situation, then to do something is going to put you or that other person in a worse situation from a professional perspective. I advise people to understand their own triggers and perhaps not do the best they can to not get into some scenarios. Sometimes we put ourselves in the way of friendly fire and other things that happen and we don't realize. I think when we find ourselves in those situations and we've escalated, and then also know to calm down, but then also know if you have reporting mechanisms and systems in place within the company or within the academia to report what has happened to you and to have maybe intervention in that process. You have that ability in some scenarios to have a mediator, if you will, to help go through different scenarios with you. We have a lot of learnings even internally around, is it okay and such, and then being able to go to an OMSBUDs or a people compliance person. There are ways that you can maybe get yourself out of that situation in the moment. Deep breath, shut off the camera, walk away if it's in person, come back to them, ask, this really did bother me and I want to make sure you meant it as you said it before I address it in that way. Then go from there. We have to remember particularly in professional settings, it's not personal, it's business. If somebody attacks you personally, you have the right to have a remedy from a business perspective. If it's in your personal life, then you may handle it a little bit differently, but I do still encourage de-escalating oneself first is important. We can only control the controllables. I really can't control what you do or how you act, but I can control how I respond. Okay, sounds good. Deep breath, walk away, shut off camera if you're online. For me, take a walk or pray. Whatever works for you as a de-escalation mode is definitely better than getting yourself in trouble at work or even worse out in the personal life where it might be a legal situation that comes about. Okay, great advice. To take things back a little bit towards the beginning of the podcast, when we talked about going into the alien environment of the university surrounded by people who maybe have a significant head start in life, so they were probably groomed towards a particular path that you haven't had. What are some learning resources you would recommend for people to take advantage of in order to compensate for that head start and maybe even achieve parity with those peers that are in a more privileged position, for example? What are some courses, directions in life that you can take, resources that you can use to try to achieve parity? I think some of the basic things like reading books, that's a big one, that you can help to learn and grow and understand even what's out there. Taking courses like our digital skills initiative and things where they're free, they're online, understanding what's available to you, that's a big deal. Looking at community service organizations that offer these types of learnings too is a big deal. Getting actual certification, so I have my CPA, my Six Sigma Green Belt, my certified diversity executive license, there are licensures you can get, you can go back to school for additional degrees. I think in today's world, the best recommendation is leveraging technology, whether that's a YouTube class, I know my son has taught himself to do many things on there and he has a college degree. Whether it's a podcast, like this, that you're learning from, if it's the traditional ways of learning, all of those can add value to even the playing field. I remember feeling somewhat as a disadvantaged and I went to people in my circle who I felt like, hey, have you encountered this before? What are you doing? How can I do the same? So never underestimate the power of those people in your circle and those conversations as well. But today's resources, I'd say our learning and certifications, whether it's digital skills initiatives, open.sap.com, whether it's a podcast, a YouTube, those types of things, but certainly look for multiple ways of learning. As companies now are having multiple pathways initiatives to get in the door before it is a fast, hard requirement to have a college degree. Today, it's good to have a college degree. Yes. And there are other ways that you can elevate your level of education to even a playing field and be on par and bring about parity in terms of the opportunities that will be available to you in getting educated. And then being a continuous learner. So even once you do have it and you're achieving your initial baseline level of parity in the workplace or in entrepreneurial experience, that you are also a continuous learner and advancing your career. Okay. Yeah. Internet search is free. YouTube is free. Most of this stuff is at one's fingertips. SAP has gotten the memo. We're starting to put our learning content out there for free on learning.sap.com. So I hope that the availability of these resources could help, I guess, people in all societies reach parity with what those who are born with more already get. And I can say as head of North American Diversity and Inclusion, I've been very intentional to work with our ecosystem internally and externally and our other DNI practitioners to really force this information out that we have from SAP from a digital learning perspective at the high school level and the college level, right? Because we have to get there younger and younger. I mean, we even met with some middle schoolers a few weeks back and we're going to be hosting some next week. It's really important to get in front of the students earlier, because if they feel like they have a shot at being on parity, being on par with others and bring a parity about in their lives and advancing themselves outside of their current circumstances, that's very important, right? Earlier in life. And specific to SAP, and you mentioned a digital skills initiative, OpenSAP. What is your tips or what is your advice to folks who are on the outside who don't even know what SAP is to start and maybe consider entering the SAP ecosystem? What would be some of the first steps somebody should take? Go visit the website. Register for some of the courses that we are offering for free and boot camps and things that are out there. Joining our talent community. If you're in college, taking some tech classes and courses, but I will say I've been at SAP 16 years. I'm not a tech person, but I'm at a tech company. So understanding transferable skills, joining our talent community, going to the website, coming to our events and activities that you see that might be open in community. For sure, signing up for our free boot camps and classes and things like that that are offered, looking at some of our schools. We have a university alliances programs where our SAP curriculum is actually taught in some of the colleges and universities. So that's another way in that people don't always realize if they can take advantage of that out there in the ecosystem, that that's something that would get them even closer to an opportunity at SAP. And then again, leveraging your network and understanding the process to join our talent community and upload your resume and get some some advice around where you can use your transferable skills and being persistent. But I love the boot camps and things are being offered because that's going to give people, even if they're not students, but even professionals are looking to advance their careers and pivot their academic learnings and such to to to get to know the students and such to to advance the skill sets, make themselves more marketable, and that'll help them get into SAP. And of course, working with our customers and partners that that's something that I've seen people do to help get themselves closer to SAP. I've met a woman who had been trying to get into SAP for years, and she ended up doing so by way of working at a partner for a little while, and then come in SAP. So I'll say there's many roads to the journey and many experiences that one can have. Okay, excellent. As we approach the end of the podcast, I always want to maybe possibly go into Q&A. So we have a couple people on as guests here. I always want to collect some some final words of wisdom for our listeners out there who might be interested in joining SAP, the SAP ecosystem, or just are trying to trying to get ahead or whatever endeavor that they're currently pursuing. What would be your your words of advice to them out there? So my words of advice would be to be open to opportunities. They come in different ways, shapes, and sizes, right? Be aware of challenges and be adaptive to those challenges and changes and circumstances that you might face. And then thing I would say is identify your own motivators and drivers, making sure that they are aligned with your long term trajectory, and that's your own course to do it. Have a personal board of directors, so both, you know, internal, external, personal, personally, and professionally is very important. And that being a continuous learner, I want to come back to that because I think that is so very important to understand that you you know, you learn on the job, you learn with formal training, you learn at HAP. And then lastly, I think, you know, when you think about climbing a ladder of any sort, you want to in the career world, I'll say, you want to know that there is more than one way to reach the top. So you move upward, you can move sideways, you know, you think about a rock climbing wall, there's a lot of different ways to get to the top. So I think understanding that and navigating that, and being willing to go through those different moves up, down, and sideways will go a long way to achieving your goals. Yeah, and not not being deterred when you need to take a detour sometimes. No, not at all. It's just a new way. Alright, so thank you, Margo, for your time and your expertise and your experience and sharing your story. Thank you for having me. Until next time, everybody.
