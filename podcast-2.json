On behalf of the whole SAP family, I would like to thank you for tuning in. It's July and it marks the monsoon season here. With rains, it brings hope, joy and new beginnings. Talking about new beginnings, this episode brings you two main sections. First, the new additions made to SAP PTP and then about this new partnership between SAP and Google Cloud announced at SAP Sapphire this year. So let's dive in. Starting with the first section, let's hear some selections of the new additions made to SAP PTP services. On the SAP PTP cockpit side, there's added transparency now for the unauthorized subaccounts and directories in Cockpit's account explorer. In the account explorer page in the SAP PTP cockpit, we now show which subaccounts and directories you don't have authorization to access with a logged icon. Also on the SAP PTP cockpit side, has now integrated built-in support that enables S users to get customer help more easily, quickly and accurately, all directly within the cockpit. It can be used to search for information in the SAP support knowledge base, report issues to SAP, contact SAP for real-time support and to interact with the digital assistant. We have also added a hide unauthorized entities checkbox so you can hide all subaccounts and directories that you don't have access to. On the SAP build app side, Android builds are now available in the build service. These were just few selections from the list of items that are new to SAP PTP. To know more, take a look at the links mentioned in the show notes. Now moving to the section where we invite guests to discuss on some selected topics, this time we have two guests. Sangeeta Krishnamurthy, a senior development architect from platform adoption and advisory team and Rahul Tiwari, a product expert in the HANA database and analytics cross product management team. And we will be talking about the partnership of SAP and Google Cloud to build the future of open data and AI for the enterprises. Welcome Sangeeta and Rahul to our July episode of SAP BTP talk. Hi Gaurav. Hi Gaurav. Thank you. Welcome. So, Sangeeta and Rahul, whenever we invite experts in our podcast, we play a small fun guessing game with them. Do you want to give it a try? Sure. Sure. Great. So, the game is I'll be reading an abstract, mostly sci-fi related and you must guess from where it is like a movie, a web series name or a famous quote. You can always ask for hints. Ready? Yeah. Sure. So, the abstract is and you must guess from where this is and here it is. In a medieval futuristic kingdom, the citizens are protected by the Institute for Elite Knights established by the legendary heroine, Gloreth, who a thousand years ago vanquished a great black monster and enclosed the kingdom with a high wall for its safety. Where is it from and name if you may guess. I think I'm in Neera Hind. Okay. Rahul, any guess from your side? And now hint or trick it. Okay. Great. So, your first hint is one of the main characters is a mysterious teenage shape-shifter who is abandoned by the society for her powers. Any wild guesses? Is it an animated story? Yeah, you're pretty close. Pretty close, Sangeet, I would say. I don't know. Rahul, any guesses? If not, we'll take another hint if there is one. Yeah, obviously there is one. In total, you get three hints. Rahul, any guesses from your side? I'm not sure. Okay. So, we're going to go for a second one. Hint. Okay. So, your second hint is one of the taglines here is a new hero or a shero takes shape. Any guesses? No, I give up. Okay. So, the third hint was pretty close. You know, Sangeet, you just were pretty much close. So, this is, I would say, a movie, animated movie streaming on Netflix and it goes by the name of Nimona where, you know, the main character is a mysterious teenage shape-shifter and it's a decent watch, I would say. So, yeah, if time permits, give it a shot. Great. No worries. Now, we resume back to the topic for which we invited Hugh to the talk. And Sangeet and Rahul, we, you know, did talk about this partnership in the previous episodes, but still, can you briefly explain about this partnership between SAP and Google for our first-time listeners? That would be really great. So, SAP and Google have partnered in this analytic space. So, we have exclusive partnership. Now, why this partnership, right? So, if you look from a macro perspective at the organizations and our customers, they're currently struggling to get value out of their data, right? So, they're spending a lot of time consolidating the data from disparate landscapes, right? Using a myriad set of tools and especially if it comes to getting value from SAP data as well. There's lots of products out there, right, from other competitors, but then there are a lot of challenges associated and customers are not able to get the value that they want out of their data sets. And they're making a lot of investment in data and AI, but then to make those investments fruitful is currently an ongoing challenge. And if you look at the recent Harvard Business Review, so I'm quoting it, that mentions that about 97% of these companies are investing in data and AI initiatives, but only 20% ever achieve their models into production, right? So, that kind of signifies the magnitude of the investment and the ongoing challenge in terms of getting the value from the data sets, right? And this is where partnership with Google, SAP and Google will bring a unique offering to the market. And with the power of our joint portfolio, we intend to offer a unified market-leading data experience and advanced analytics and AI at scale, right? So as part of the partnership, we will offer product integration, bi-directional product integration, which will allow customers to federate or integrate data between our portfolio and specifically with our business data fabric, SAP DataSphere, and then on Google site, Google BigQuery, there will be smooth integration where customers will be able to seamlessly federate or integrate data for the scenarios and use cases, and then also use tools such as SAP Analytics Cloud for planning scenarios or let's say for AML scenarios, tools such as Vertex AI, and then get the intended value from the data set. So that's the unique value we will bring to the market. And this partnership also has joint go-to-market, co-sell motions that SAP and Google are currently working on, and then of course supported by the type product integration that I mentioned earlier. So this is a very unique offering to the market and our customers will benefit from the power of our joint portfolio and the partnerships that we have with Google. Indeed, Raul. This is a very unique offering to the market. You did mention about bi-directional integration. So how does BTP services like SAP DataSphere and SAC augment this initiative? Sure I can take that. As Raul said, one of the main aspects of this partnership is the integration between SAP DataSphere, which is our BTP service, and Google BigQuery. So as you know, SAP DataSphere combines mission critical data with the data from across the enterprise landscape, regardless of its origin, while keeping the business data and semantics intact. And BTP service, SAP Analytics Cloud on the other hand, helps render this unified data from the SAP DataSphere into powerful visualization to help the businesses derive, let's say, intelligent insights. So thus this partnership enables the customer to build an end-to-end data cloud that helps them to view their entire data estates in real time. And so this helps them to maximize their value from the Google Cloud, as well as SAP software investment, I would say. So I would be curious to know how does Google's architecture also fits into this overall SAP DataSphere partnerships that were also announced some time back? Can you talk on that part? Yeah, I can take that. So SAP has partnered with the open data ecosystem of leading technology vendors, right? And the goal is to provide tailored integration between our business data fabric, which is DataSphere, and then their solutions with the intent to elevate organizations need to have a simplified and modern data landscape, right? Now if you look overall with the five partners that we have, so namely Databricks, Confluent, Ecolibra, Google, and DataRobot, so with each of these partners, we are solving a unique problem for our customers, right? And at the same time, we are also generating a pull for SAP DataSphere and monetizing the relationship as well with these partners. So for example, for Databricks, we are solving the problem that data scientists can easily access SAP data in notebook environments, right? Massage the data and get insights that they're trying to create in these notebooks. With Confluent, we are ensuring that when analytical data set, including SAP data, has to be consumed by, let's say, a multitude of downstream applications, then we are able to lend the data seamlessly into generic targets such as Kafka for this easy sharing and consumption, right? So that's the problem we solved with Confluent. With Ecolibra, similarly, we offer an enterprise-wide data governance solution together with SAP and Ecolibra's offering. Similarly with DataRobot, we are trying to achieve a self-service and easy way of building AI ML models, right? And now if you look at Google specifically, so with this partnership, as I mentioned also before, our intent is to offer a modern data platform, right, and offer advanced analytics and AI at scale with a very tight product integration. So overall, this fits into our business data fabric narrative and the open ecosystem, open data platform, right? And together, SAP and Google will accelerate and enhance the business data fabric value and enable our customers to achieve business value from the data sets, right? The key problem that they face today. So that's how this partnership is in close alignment with the vision we have with, let's say, overall open data ecosystem approach with our business data fabric and is a key component of this vision. Wonderful, Rahul. And this concept of open data ecosystem definitely sounds music to ears. My next question would be, do we have some published use cases that are leveraging the benefits of this partnership we can already share with our listeners? Of course, yes. At Sapphire, we have published about nine different use cases showcasing the SAP data sphere and Google Cloud integration, leveraging the data federation architecture of SAP data sphere. These use cases span across real-time analytics to mission learning to planning scenarios. So let's maybe take an example of real-time analytics use case through this example. Analyzing the category performance of online sales by combining Google Analytics and sales data from BigQuery with the discount data from the SAP systems in real time. So this actually eliminates the need to replicate or duplicate data for doing such analytics, which was how it was traditionally done earlier. So this is a very classic example of real-time analytics. And next, let's take the example of a financial planning use case. Now we show how we are able to seamlessly integrate large volumes of external financial records from Google BigQuery into SAP data sphere for improved financial planning, reporting, and analysis that we do in SAP Analytics Cloud. And third, just for another example of the mission learning use case, businesses, again, will now be able to use Google's AI and ML services to train models on data from SAP and non-SAP systems in real time. Yeah, these are some examples. Great. Thanks, Sangeetha, for sharing those real-time examples. Can you also please tell us more about the Vertex AI integration that you just now talked about? Sure. Yeah, for the mission learning use case that I mentioned earlier, we show how data scientists can now have instant access to the unified SAP and non-SAP data and leverage Google Vertex AI capabilities to build, train, and deploy models. To do this, we provide a Python library called FedML. This is available in the PyPy repository that helps source the data from the unified data models from SAP Data Sphere in real time for the data scientists into the Vertex AI ML platform. So this actually eliminates the need to do expensive extract transform load, which we call the ETL, of the source data into the mission learning platform in order to do the training. To know more about this and other Google integration use cases and to try them, we have actually released Discovery Center missions. You will find links to those missions, I think, in the podcast page. So listeners, don't worry. All the links, all the real-time scenarios that Sangeetha Jashnath talked about, the links to them and to those missions will be shared in the show notes. So feel free to check them out. Also guys, when we talk about these scenarios, there is often this debate, which one to choose, like federation over replication. So is there some golden guides or some guidance on federation over replication or vice versa that can be referred by implementing these scenarios? Sure, yeah. Actually several factors play a role in determining if data needs to be replicated or federated for building unified data models in SAP Data Sphere, like data volume and the nature of analysis, et cetera. I can say that for users that require huge volumes of non-SAP data for analysis done on SAP platform with very critical SAP data set, we suggest doing a snapshot replication for near real-time data, near to real-time data analysis. And for scenarios that require live queries to be done every time for getting better business insights, such as analytics on, let's say, IoT and logistics shipment location data for logistic use case, we suggest using the data federation. So it depends on the use case. Very nicely put, Sangeetha. Now, when we talk about such scenarios where multiple systems are involved, which you both just now talked about, integration takes the center stage. So my question is, which integration types are supported between SAP Data Sphere and Google Cloud Platform? If you can put some light on that. Sure. Actually, several data integration mechanisms are possible already, as Rahul also said. And some are actually planned for SAP Data Sphere and Google Cloud Platform in the future. So existing BigQuery connection in SAP Data Sphere, for example, helps integrate BigQuery data for data federation. We are the data federation, yeah? And existing data flows in SAP Data Sphere helps to replicate the Google storage data into the SAP Data Sphere. And also, currently, the existing FedML library, for example, it can be used for ferreting SAP Data Sphere data out into the vertex AI for machine learning purposes, as I mentioned earlier. And replication flow is another type of integration that will be available soon, along with reverse data federation, again, in the roadmap for analytics done in the Google Platform on unified SAP Data Sphere models. Great. So this, I'm sure, definitely will give some relief to our listeners out there. Definitely. A $1 million question. How do we tackle security when the scenarios are so complex? And I can take that. So from a data security perspective, if you look at core offering for the partnership, and that revolves around SAP Data Sphere and Google BigQuery, of course, SAP Data Sphere has current features, right? So data access controls and other features that could be used for configuring your security. And Google BigQuery similarly has its own data governance and security features, right? So customers could leverage those. And in addition, another area we are looking at is, for example, there may be some customers who would want more secure or private connectivity between, let's say, Data Sphere and BigQuery when they have this unified portfolio, right? So this is one of the areas where we are investigating the private connect topic and trying to see the options to make that secure. So there are some possibilities with Google's offering of private Google access, which we are currently assessing, that offers the routing of the communication more securely, right? So not over the public internet, but securely in the internet and others. So that's what we are looking into. And we'll publish more info and guidance as soon as we validate and test that part as well. So those are some of the areas that people can look into to get more insights into the security domain. Great. So, Listas, as you heard right, there are already being great advancements being done on this topic of security. Implementing these use cases at customer landscapes is something that our listeners would be very much interested in. So are there some certified partners who are implementing this at customer landscapes whom we can already reach out to? So at program level, SAP and Google are tapping into the usual global service partners that we have. So for example, we have, and we worked with them closely anyway, irrespective of the offering, right? So for example, some of them are Accenture, Deloitte, PwC, Capgemini and others. So we are having conversations with them around the partnership, enablement, et cetera, right? So those would be leveraged as well for this scenario. Then we are also working with the leading data analytics value added resellers. So for example, in North America, we are working with Entity Data, Simplified, Aplexus and others. And these are what two sort of partner and value added resellers that will be leveraging to kind of help support the implementation of scenarios related to the partnership and provide scale to our customers in the implementation. Awesome. Thanks all for sharing that insight and it's so great to see the ecosystem coming together for enabling customers to adopt cloud technologies. So wonderful to hear that. How does the roadmap looks under this partnership, if you can talk about that? Sure. So broadly speaking, roadmap can be split into three categories. So first, of course, the infrastructure, and then we have this bi-directional connectivity, which can be split into bi-directional federation and bi-directional replication, right? Between DataSphere and BigQuery. So let's first talk about infrastructure coverage. So one of the key things that our teams are working on is expanding the coverage of our key analytics product on Google data centers, right? So Google Cloud Platform. So what does that mean? So that means deploying HANA, SAP Analytics Cloud and DataSphere, making them available for customers to choose on Google Cloud Platform, right? So this year in Q1, we delivered SAP Analytics Cloud HANA on Google Cloud Platform. Q2, we delivered SAP DataSphere and GCP IOWA. So now I have that and North America availability. And what we are working on is adding Europe and Asia Pacific. So namely, Frankfurt and Mumbai data center coverage will be added in Q4 this year for our analytics portfolio. So DataSphere, SSE, all of those will be available for customers to choose on those environments. And then next year, we will keep on adding more data centers. So this will expand to Israel, Saudi Arabia, and other data centers, right? And this will continue on for the next 12 to 24 months. We'll keep expanding. So that's the first category, right? The infrastructure. And now if you look at the connectivity, so let's talk about federation. So intent is we have tighter integration between DataSphere and BigQuery. So if you look at federation, so today SAP DataSphere can already federate data from BigQuery. So we have that feature already today. Now what is missing is the reverse, meaning if customers want to federate the data from DataSphere into BigQuery, that's something from official adapter perspective is not there in BigQuery, right? They can, of course, connect via OpenSQL, JDBC, and other mechanism, but the dedicated adapter itself is not there. So this is something that we are working with Google. And currently, a technical proposal is being reviewed between the both sides to kind of form up the implementation approach. And then Google will be building this adapter early next year to kind of allow this federation, right, from DataSphere into BigQuery. So that's one, right? So that's one topic there. Now if you talk about bi-directional replication. So SAP DataSphere can already snapshot replicate from BigQuery, as Sangeetha mentioned earlier. So we don't have real-time replication currently, but it's more snapshot. And Google BigQuery, on the other hand, does not have any supported, from SAP perspective, any replication mechanism. So what we are building in this partnership is a dedicated connector in SAP DataSphere that will allow this replication of data from slash wire DataSphere into BigQuery. So that's something SAP is building. So it will be SAP-built connector approved by both companies. And then on the reverse side, so we do have snapshot replication, but what about adding high-volume data replication, real-time scenario for BigQuery into DataSphere? So that's something as well that SAP and Google are working on. We are currently reviewing the technical proposal for this as well, in terms of how that integration should work. And the intent is that we will also deliver this connector after we have delivered the BQ connector to replicate it into BQ. So broadly, those are the three categories of product integration and infrastructure topic that both teams are working on. Awesome, Rav, like at least to me, this looks very promising and also gets me excited, especially on the data centers expansion and with the work on the adapters. With that, I would like to put a break to my questions and I would like to thank both of you for taking your time and helping our listeners to learn more about this partnership between SAP and Google Cloud. I'm sure this conversation helped our listeners to gain a deeper knowledge on this topic, at least it did to me, and also motivated them to try out the use cases that we discussed. Thank you so much, Sangeeta and Rahul, for taking your time. Thanks for having us. Thank you, Rav. That was Sangeeta and Rahul, who talked about how SAP and Google Cloud, with their partnership, unlocks entirely new opportunities for enterprises to derive more value from their full data footprints. We discussed how SAP enables enterprises to build an end-to-end data cloud that brings data across the heterogeneous data landscapes using the SAP data sphere together with Google's data cloud. So businesses can view their entire data in real time and maximize value from their SAP software and Google Cloud investments. You can check out the SAP Discovery Center actionable use cases around this topic that brings to you the business scenarios where the service can accelerate your business transformation, enabling access to authoritative data and enriching all data projects.
